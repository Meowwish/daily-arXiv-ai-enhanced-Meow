Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "As wide-field optical surveys such as Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) begin operations, time-domain astronomy is facing a data revolution, paving the road for new, expanded variability studies. This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate."}

For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution."}

Potential impacts from these processes can be seen in the complex and interconnected signatures of AGN and star formation activity throughout a galaxy. Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole."}

The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \\pm 1.9\\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (gOM), with $\\sim 5\\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \\pm 1.3\\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics."}

Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \\gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \\gtrsim 10^9 \\, M_\\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$Δβ$ plane, where $Δβ$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \\sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions."}

Studying the kinematics of outflows in different gas phases is crucial for comprehending how AGNs impact the ISM within their host galaxies. However, the differences in the physical natures of ionized and warm molecular gas outflows remain largely unexplored. To obtain a complete picture of AGN outflows and their feedback effects, we present a study of both ionized and warm molecular gas outflows in six type-2 AGNs ($z<0.1$) that exhibit strong ionized outflows in previous optical observations. Utilizing the Triple Spectrograph and Double Spectrograph instruments on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, we conduct spatially resolved measurements in the slit direction of strong emission lines from both ionized and warm molecular gas, such as $\\rm [O\\ III]$, $\\rm Paα$, $\\rm H_{2}$ 1-0 S(1), etc., allowing for a direct comparison of their outflow properties. One out of six AGNs shows significant ionized and warm molecular outflows in near-infrared bands, exhibiting the most powerful kinematics and highest luminosity. A positive correlation between the kinematics and AGN luminosity is shown, suggesting that more luminous AGNs, which reflect higher levels of AGN activity, tend to have a greater impact on the gases, probably driving the outflows."}

We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\\log M_{200}/M_\\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$).

A first extensive comparison between real and synthetic data", "comment": "23 pages, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "LOFAR observations of diffuse interstellar polarization at meter wavelengths reveal intricate polarized intensity structures with an unexpected correlation with neutral HI filaments that could not be reproduced in simulations with low cold neutral medium (CNM) abundance. We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium."}
